# Jolie File Worker

This is a Java Service to split and unsplit a file, with a correlated Jolie test service to embed the File Worker and use it in Jolie projects.

1. In case you want to modify the Java Service, open it in your favourite IDE and work on it as a Maven project.
2. Use the `jar` file produced from the *build* Maven process and place it in the `test/lib` folder.
3. Run `jolie file_worker_test.ol` into a shell to test it.
